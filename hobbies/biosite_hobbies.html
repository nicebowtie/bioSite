<h2>Gotta Catch 'Em All</h2>
<p>Finally, if Sarah isn’t on stage, in the studio, or in the kitchen, she’s probably hunting for Pikachu, playing her favorite game, Pokemon Go!

Sarah is one of their most devoted followers. <span class=quote>“I love that it is truly fun for all ages. It is creative and positive and it also encourages you to get off the couch and move. It’s been a great source of joy and stress relief for me.”</span></p>
